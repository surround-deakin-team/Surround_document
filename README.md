# Surround AI
Surround AI  is the python framework which is designed for flexible usage in Artificial Intelligence(AI). It is designed to support data scientist in their progress. Each and every scientist use different algorithm to solve different problems. There are no standard way for them to analyse altogether in a single module. To provide a standard solution surround frame work is built. Evolution of machine learning pipeline  is not possible without re-constructing the coding whereas surround package will provide a pipeline without any alterations.

# Why surround?
* It is designed to support data scientist in their progress.
*  Each and every scientist use different algorithm to solve different problems. There are no standard way for them to analyse altogether in a single module.
*   To provide a standard solution surround framework is built. 
*  Every machine learning pipeline can be accessed for getting the appropriate solution instead of reffering many machine learning packages.
# Usage
* Helping the data scientists in analytics instead            
using glue codes for their research.
*  Easy interaction between several machine learning pipelines.
* Provides end-to-end solution instead of providing solution for the models.
# Current
Using cloud API for training models for image recognition.
Developing a pipeline for the surround module using machine learning algorithms.

# Surround Working
First clone the surround repository in your system.
## Windows:-
1.) Install the python 3.7.3 in the system by following the provided link that is given below-
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.) Pip3 is installed in your system by default when you install Python.

3.) Set paths for both in Environment variables.

4.) Open command prompt.

5.) Type python to ensure that python is successfully installed in your system.

6.) Then type exit() to get out from python environment.

7.) Then type pip3 install surround

8.) Surround is installed in system.

It successfully installed in windows.

## Mac:-



# How to create a project
After installation of surround using pip3
* **Type** surround -h
* You can see list of help option in surround with **commands**

# Sample for Surround using Yolo 9000:
## Yolo 9000
> Yolo is the object detection system on a Pascal Titan X it processes images at 30 FPs and has a map of 57.9%. It can identify more than 9000 objects using image net classification and COCO detection dataset. 
## Yolo in surround
**Object detection in Image can be done in surround using Yolo 9000.**
> **Note:** we can use yolo in python with the help of openCV DNN(Deep Neural Networks).
### Installing dependencies: 
1.	Python 3.
2.	Numpy.
3.	OpenCV.
4.	Surround.
### Input arguments for image detection:
1.	Read image.
2.	Config file of Yolo.
3.	Use pre trained yolo weights.
4.	Text file containing class names.

# Conclusion:
Surround is under development which as goals to satisfy the needs of data scientists. It completely turns the view of analysing in machine learning and other concepts of AI(Artificial Intelligence).
